On September 20th 2025, I got a message from my mother saying that Yuchao Zheng, my maternal grandfather was in
the hospital for severe abdominal pains. The doctors had found a growth on his pancreas, stating that it was
almost certain to be cancerous, and way too big to be operable. The prognosis was that he had less than 6 months
to live. At 90 years old, even doing a biopsy would risk potential complications, let alone attempt chemo
or radiation therapy. It was decided to make his last months as comfortable as possible. He deliberately chose
to forego hospice treatment.

This wasn't his first brush with cancer. Just 15 years ago, he had a virulent instance of prostate cancer.
We had luckily caught it early and it was summarily beat it with radiation therapy.

Today, on XXXXXXX, YYth, 202Z, he passed away.

It was 1994. I was firstborn of a litter of kids in a multigenerational immigrant household. 
My dad had just got laid off from his chemical engineering job, dabbling in enterpenuership with my uncle,
and my mom had just quit her meteoric software engineering career to help them get off the ground.
My early years were characterized by my parents frantically trying to spin up their business and fulfill their
version of the American dream. They'd always come home late, so the daytime care for me or my siblings came down
to my maternal grandparents, who we always affectionately called by their Chinese familial epithet waigong (外公,
grandfather), and waipo (外婆, grandmother). To me, my waigong and waipo were as instrumental to my upbringing
as my parents were.

Among the six of us grandchildren that grew up with them, I probably have spent the most time with waigong.
One of my fondest memories of my childhood was burning the autumn leaves with him in our backyard.

Like most Asian (grand)parents, he would rarely, if ever, tell me "I love you", usually only when I
told him that directly and only in an awkward way. He instead *showed* his love through actions that always
spoke magnitudes louder than words. Whenever I came home, there was always a warm meal of my favorite foods,
cooked by his hands. Whenever he would pick me up from school, there was a small bag of candy in the glove
box. Returning home as an adult, there was always a pristinely maintained and warm bed to rest in.
For more than thirty years, home was a safe haven where I could always return to. No judgement. No evaluation.
No questions. Home was where waigong and and waipo were. Now with him gone, it'll never be the same.

He was a stoic and stalwart man. He was a man of very few words, but when he spoke, his words cut like a knife.
In his youth, he fought tooth and nail for what he believed was right, always striving to be the bigger man,
even if the very people and nation he fought alongside conspired against him. He endured immense physical and
emotional pain throughout his life, yet not once did he complain about his circumstances. He's always said that
"pain is a part of life", and that to avoid pain is deprive yourself of the experience of life. I've always
thought of my mother was always my rock, my foundation, but even she is not infallible. My waigong was her
rock: a steadfast bulwark in the face of tumultuous times.

He was a deeply intellectual man. When we were kids, he'd assign us all extra homework, in addition to our
existing schoolwork. We learned arithmetic years ahead of our peers and were all biligual at a young age. He was the one
who further stoked my interests in science and technology. I remember perusing the natural history museums and
exploratoriums with him. Later on I learned that my mother's side of the family directly descended from `XXYY`,
a disciple of Confucious, a storied family heritage of scholars and intellectuals thousands of years old, a
fact he was very proud of.

He was a frugal man. Having experienced true poverty, he absolutely wasted nothing. The homegrown
vegetables he cooked for us was, at one point, fertilized with his own urine. 

Even at the age of 90, he kept up with the latest world news and latest tech. He had very nuanced and experienced
set of opinions about modern geopolitics and I deeply regret neverk getting the chance to discuss with him in
finer detail due to my Chinese skills lacking the vocabulary to engage him at that level. He always used the latest
smartphone tech, used social media regularly, and even use apps that even I was not aware of.

 There's no need for rippling muscles, or
a jawline of a Greek god, but rather an unparalleled sharp mind and inexhaustible curiosity.
He was my ideal of what it meant to be a man. 

He always loved keeping up with world news and the latest trends, even at the age of 89, he kept a modern
cellphone with him, and used social media like any other.

Good night Waigong, may you rest in peace.
