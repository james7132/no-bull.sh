Twenty years ago, in 2006, I read my first doujinshi. I can scant remember
exactly what it was. The details of which, at this point, have been lost to the
sands of time. I thought little of it and enjoyed the effort the author had put
into it. I found a few more over the following years, thinking they were neat way
to portray your fanfiction.

Three years later, in 2009, I was perusing the niche corners of the world wide
web, from which I found not one, not ten, but hundreds and thousands of
doujinshi made for Touhou Project. I found a 1.7 TB dump of doujin music albums
arranging the music from the games. I found loads of doujin fangames made for it.
I even found two independently animated fan animes created for it. Unwittingly,
I had stumbled into one of the greatest creative cultures of our time, and the
beating heart behind Japan's greatest cultural exports. This was like casually
walking into the Library of Alexandria. It was unfathomable to my adolescent
mind. What was this Touhou Project? Why have I never heard of it before? and what
drove thousands of artists, musicians, and game developers to dedicate so much of
their time, blood, sweat, and tears to it?

I had my eyes opened to the full force of doujin culture. Little did I know, this
chance encounter would lead to a decades long effort to try to bring it to the
rest of the world. Before we can cover that, let's step back a bit and ask...

### What is doujin?
Doujin (同人) collectively refers to any self-produced and self-published art,
including manga, music, games, prints, figures, or anything else. As a first
order approximation, it's not that far off from the English term "indie" or
"independent"; however, there are a few key differences.

The first major difference is that doujin goods are typically only physically
distributed at dedicated doujin events. At first, this seems awfully backwards,
maybe even regressive, in an post-Internet age.

It's not uncommon for doujin works to be direct derivative works of another
intellectual property. In other words, fanworks. In the west, this is a nearly
unheard of, as copyright law overwhelmingly favors the IP owner. Create a fan
comic of a Disney IP like Snow White? Their lawyers will blast you with a cease
and desist before you even publish it. In Japan, copyright infringement is much
more strictly defined and thus companies aren't likely to take legal action
against individuals or smaller organizations unless they're absolutely sure
they'll win the case. This creates a legal gray zone where doujin culture has
flourished. Because of this gray zone existence, it comes with an implicit silent
social contract: "Don't grow too big, respect the original IP and its holders,
and they'll look the other way while you sell your fanwork."

As events, doujin events differ signifcantly from artist alleys seen in American
and European conventions in their scope and purpose. I presume many artist alleys
started the same way most doujin events did: gathering together artists looking
to sell fan works to other likeminded fans. However, as conventions grew and so
did the economic opprotunity presented by artist alleys. This has resulted in
increasingly complex displays, higher entrance costs, higher skill floor, and
more commercialization. There are artists that now can live entirely off of
selling their art at these artist alleys week to week. This heavily
commercialized approach also tends to focus on products that maximize profit
margins. Poster prints, acrylic keychains, and acrylic standees are all
exceptionally cheap to mass produce and yield very high margins, and thus
dominate what is sold in these artist alleys. Artists may also hire proxies to
stand in their place so they can sell their art at multiple events in the same
weekend. With the increasing popularity of many artists in the space, getting a
spot at one of these events is becoming increasingly difficult, with many
conventions increasing table prices, filtering out applicants, or going as far as
to implement lottery systems.  All of this by no means is a bad thing: I ain't
gonna fault people for putting food on the table; however, this collectively means
there's are huge skill and monetary barriers to entry.

On the other hand, because of the implicit social contract behind it, doujin
works remains predominatly a hobby for many of its participants. Doujin events
like Comiket even employ strict rules on what can be used in a circle's table
display and price controls to ensure that circles aren't trying to compete
commercially or profitmaxx off of their buyers. Because of this, an overwhelming
85% or more of doujin circles actually never make a profit of their work.

Despite the cost, many doujin artists and developers continue to produce more
works out of pure passion. That's what I enjoy the most about doujin: everyone is
doing it out of love for their craft. Better yet, that passion is contagious.
Many of those who admire the works of those before them are often inspired to
create their own. It's a virtuous cycle brimming with creative chaos.

From that chaos, we've seen many rise to greatness. Many of the biggest
international hit intellectual properties we've seen come out of Japan like
[Tsukihime][tsukihime], [Higurashi][higurashi], and [Touhou Project][touhou] all
got their start as doujin works. The open creative space provides a much needed
space for creatives of all kinds to refine their craft and
