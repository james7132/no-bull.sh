I've had this blog, on its various domains, for probably close to 10 years now.
I've written quite a few articles, yet have published basically *none* of them.
Each time I've written something, my perfectionist tendencies would repeatedly
stop me just short of actually publishing and let perfect be the enemy of good
enough.

Today, that ends.

I've had this horrible decades-long habit of just enduring whatever bullshit
comes my way, staying silent until I can't bear it anymore. With all of the
events over the past few years, this only seems to gets worse, and it's becoming
increasingly clear that I can not and should not stay silent anymore. It is
precisely why this site is under the **no-bull.sh** domain. I'm sick and tired of
all of the bullshit, the willful ignorance, and the slop surrounding us, and it's
due time for that frustration to find a healthy outlet.

If you've worked with me professionally in the past, these posts may very well be
a bit of a shock: I will not be self-censoring myself. Close friends know I can
be extremely crass, and, at times, very abrasive. For good reason, I would hope.

If this sounds like this is only a place for me to vent, I won't deny that it
will have a lot of potentially unhinged rants. However, it won't be the only
thing I will write about.  In the coming weeks and months, I will strive to
post new articles on this blog. There's already few ideas that need to be
fleshed out:

 * My opinions on LLMs and the AI hype cycle.
 * Doujin culture in the United States in 2026 and beyond.
 * Digital freedom and privacy in a increasingly authoritarian world.
 * The current state of writing panic free code in Rust.
 * Collaboration on FOSS projects in a multipolar world.
 * The importance of FOSS governance.
 * Using technology to address social problems.
 * Life and death, grief and loss within the family.
 * Anti-features and the rise of techno-Ludditism.
 * The collapse of the open web.
 * ... and many more!

If you'd like to join me on this adventure and be kept up to date on my latest
ramblings, I'll be broadcasting each on [BlueSky][bluesky] and this site provides
an [RSS feed][rss-feed].
