I've written quite a few articles, yet have published basically <em>none</em> of them. Each time I've written something, my perfectionist tendencies would repeatedly stop me just short of actually publishing and let perfect be the enemy of good enough.<p>Today, that ends.<p>I've had this horrible decades-long habit of just enduring whatever bullshit comes my way, staying silent until I can't bear it anymore. With all of the events over the past few years, this only seems to gets worse, and it's becoming increasingly clear that I can not and should not stay silent anymore. It is precisely why this site is under the <strong>no-bull.sh</strong> domain. I'm sick and tired of all of the bullshit, the willful ignorance, and the slop surrounding us, and it's due time for that frustration to find a healthy outlet.<p>If you've worked with me professionally in the past, these posts may very well be a bit of a shock: I will not be self-censoring myself. Close friends know I can be extremely crass, and, at times, very abrasive. For good reason, I would hope.<p>If this sounds like this is only a place for me to vent, I won't deny that it will have a lot of potentially unhinged rants. However, it won't be the only thing I will write about. In the coming weeks and months, I will strive to post new articles on this blog. There's already few ideas that need to be fleshed out:<ul><li>My opinions on LLMs and the AI hype cycle.<li>Doujin culture in the United States in 2026 and beyond.<li>Digital freedom and privacy in a increasingly authoritarian world.<li>The current state of writing panic free code in Rust.<li>Collaboration on FOSS projects in a multipolar world.<li>The importance of FOSS governance.<li>Using technology to address social problems.<li>Life and death, grief and loss within the family.<li>Anti-features and the rise of techno-Ludditism.<li>The collapse of the open web.<li>... and many more!</ul><p>If you'd like to join me on this adventure and be kept up to date on my latest ramblings, I'll be broadcasting each on <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/no-bull.sh rel=external>BlueSky</a> and this site provides an <a href=/atom.xml>RSS feed</a>.<p id=page-footer>Tags: <a href=/blog/tag/personal>Personal</a> <br> <a href=/atom.xml>RSS Feed</a> | <a href=https://no-bull.sh/blog/2026/01/20/fuck-it-we-write/>Permalink</a></section></div><footer class="footer has-text-centered is-align-items-flex-end mt-auto"><p><strong>© 2026 James Liu</strong> - Powered by <a href=https://www.getzola.org>Zola</a> and <a href=https://bulma.io>Bulma</a>.<p><a < a href=mailto:contact@no-bull.com>Contact Me</a> | <a href=https://github.com/james7132/no-bull.sh>Source Code</a>.</footer>
