My personal website. Built with [zola](https://www.getzola.org/),
[SponsorKit](https://github.com/antfu/sponsorkit), and GitHub Pages.

## Building
The entire site can be built with `zola build`. Editing can be done live with
`zola serve`.

## Contributing
While this project is hosted on a git forge with pull request support and is 
under an open source license, this is a personal website built for exclusively 
for my use. Thus, I will not be accepting PRs attempting to substantively alter
the content on it.
